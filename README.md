# Shopify to X-Express import app

This is very simple app you can use to import orders from Shopify to X-Express Currier online app. Just edit config file provided in server directory.
If you change server port also change port in ./client/api.js file.

If your X-Express API does not work contact your sales agent.

Before you start to use app. Build your client app. With npm run build then copy dist files to ./server/public. You only need to do this once.
